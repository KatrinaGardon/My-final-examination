Git is a distributed version control
technology for managing the source code history 
of a development project, and GitHub is a cloud-based platform based on Git.
Git is a local program that a developer installs on their computer, but GitHub is an internet service that keeps code sent to it from Git-enabled machines. 
Git differs from GitHub in that it is an open-source project.
