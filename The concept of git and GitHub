Git is a distributed version control system, as opposed to centralized subversion. This means that with Subversion, the code repository (repo) is hosted on a server, and people must have particular permissions (commit rights) to contribute to the repository. 
Its version control system, GitHub, enables for seamless collaboration without jeopardizing the original project's integrity. Open-source software can be found in the projects on GitHub.
